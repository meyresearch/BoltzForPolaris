# Project Overview  

This repository is a work in progress and will be updated as I progress through the challenge.  

## Files and Directories  

- **`pred_test.ipynb`** – The main file where I experiment with the data and model.  
- **`reference_structures/`** – Contains reference complex PDB files for aligning test data.  
- **`reference_complex/`** – Contains complexes used for aligning training data.  
- **`test_ligand_bond_fixed/`** – Stores prediction data with bonds corrected using an updated script to transfer bond knowledge.  
- **`train_ligand_bond_fixed/`** – Contains Boltz-1 predictions for the first 100 molecules in the training data. Its missing the 0th molecule, so 99 molecules effectively. The first molecule has some issues.
